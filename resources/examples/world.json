    "description": "Aetheria is a world suspended in the vast, cerulean expanse of the Aether. Floating islands, some as small as villages and others spanning entire continents, drift gently in this infinite sky. The ancient Elari Empire, masters of airship technology and cloudforged weaponry, once united the islands, before The Sundering of 1432 S.E. fractured their control. Now, factions like the Windward Traders Guild and the militant Skysteel Covenant vie for dominion over the skies. Legends speak of the Aether Heart, a mystical artifact believed to control the very currents of the sky, lost since The Sundering.",
