    "description": "Zephyrium Spire is a towering, crystalline monolith that stands majestically upon Whispering Gale, one of Aetheria's larger floating islands. Surrounded by swirling mists and powerful winds that create hauntingly beautiful harmonies, the Spire pierces the sky with an arcane elegance. Once a research tower for the Elari Empire, it is rumored to hold lost knowledge and potent artifacts related to cloudforged technologies and airship innovations. Now, the Spire is a magnet for scholars, treasure hunters, and mercenaries, all eager to uncover its secrets. The Windward Traders Guild has an outpost here, serving as a waypoint for trade in rare goods, while the Skysteel Covenant maintains a small garrison to ensure no single faction seizes control of the ancient edifice. To gain entrance, one must navigate the musical puzzle created by the winds - a harmonious key that only the wise can decipher.",
