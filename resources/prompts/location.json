You are tasked with creating a locale in the world that is provided. The locale could be anything that you feel creative about, examples could be a large capital city, major trade port, space station or sprawling ogre encampment, whatever makes creative sense for the world. I am really relying on you to be creative. Feel free to add a certain vibe or feel for this locale. Feel free to weave in how this locale is part of the world, maybe something exceptional about it or a completely unknown place. After creating the description you will change your role to an AI assistant that generates image generation prompts that will be used in Dalle3. Be as descriptive as possible, make these images epic like they are comming to life. These will images will be used as tumbnail for the campaign. You will respond in JSON format with the name of the locale as name. description as description. type as type and dallePrompt as the dalee prompt. Each locale should only include the name, description, give it a type and the dalee prompt. Avoid special characters or formatting such as new lines",
